  <h1>Russian Study Tools</h1>

  <p>
    These free web apps use a new, interactive learning technology to help you practice key aspects of Russian grammar and vocabulary. Unlike traditional flashcards or exercises, each app lets you customize your learning level in every session by selecting checkboxes for exactly the types of sentences you want to practice — from beginner to advanced combinations of tense, gender, and aspect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's how they work. Each app presents a challenge and a button labeled “Reveal Choices.” To get the most out of your practice, think of your own answer before revealing the choices. If you're unsure, use the multiple-choice options to learn.
  </p>

  <h2><a href="https://russian-verbs-of-motion.netlify.app/">Russian Verbs of Motion</a></h2>
  <p>
    Practice the Russian verbs of motion — with and without prefixes, by foot and by vehicle, uni- and bi-directional, and across multiple tenses and aspects. Like all of these practice apps, includes both written and spoken prompts, with Russian-to-English and English-to-Russian modes, making the apps great for Russian speakers learning English as well as English speakers learning Russian.
  </p>

  <h2><a href="https://russian-pronouns.netlify.app/">Russian Pronouns and Nouns</a></h2>
  <p>
    Build fluency with personal pronouns and their matching noun cases. Practice nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, and prepositional forms using highly effective interactive drills.
  </p>

  <h2><a href="https://russian-verbs.netlify.app/">Russian Verb Conjugations</a></h2>
  <p>
    Master all the Russian verb endings in present, past, and future tenses. Practice conjugations of both perfective and imperfective verbs across persons and genders, selecting simple combinations during your learning phase and increasingly difficult complex combinations when you're ready.
  </p>

  <h2><a href="https://russian-prepositions.netlify.app/">Russian Prepositions</a></h2>
  <p>
    Learn which prepositions pair with which cases — and how they affect noun endings. Get immediate feedback as soon as you've decided on your answer to each challenge.
  </p>

  <h2>Also by the Developer: <a href="https://aoede.pro" target="_blank">Aoede</a> –– A Language Comprehension Revolution</h2>
  <p>
    While the apps above build your Russian language skills through interactive drills, the highly advanced <strong>Aoede</strong> app tackles another side of fluency: understanding authentic spoken language. It lets you listen to thousands of classic books in your chosen study language, complete with translations into your own language and optional simplifications. You control what you hear, how fast it plays, and how deeply you engage. No lessons — just immersive, guided listening, one sentence at a time.

    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
      This set of apps was created by a lifelong language learner and experienced software developer exploring how new tools can help us master one of the world’s most difficult languages. The result is a different kind of language learning resource: completely free, interactive, deeply customizable, and designed to support your practice rather than dictate your curriculum.
